# Estimating Emissions

This folder contains scripts which generate emission estimates of UK neighbourhoods. These have been generated using the UKMRIO model in combination with the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCFS). In addition, socio-demographic variables have been extrated from the LCFS. 

Please note: _The code in this repository is incomplete and for reference only. Some scripts could not be uploaded currently as permission from all collaborators is needed first. Outputs of emission estimates will be uploaded to the University of Leeds' data repository in the future._
