# Spatial-temporal training using pysal

The scripts in this repository follow the following three tutorials:

- http://darribas.org/gds_scipy16/ipynb_md/05_spatial_dynamics.html
- https://pysal.org/notebooks/explore/giddy/Markov_Based_Methods.html
- https://pysal.org/notebooks/lib/libpysal/weights.html

These scripts apply the methods outlined in these tutorials to the tutorial datasets, as well as to the emission estimates generated in the Estimating_Emissions folder.
